# discordJS-League-Tracker

A WIP DiscordJS bot created to track game winrate with your friends, messaging the preset channel IDs when a player:

- Enters a game, including the selected champion, icon and mode
- Finishes a game, including outcome, KDA ratio and game duration

This bot was built using:
- Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/
- DiscordJS:, a Node.js module for interacting with the Discord API: https://discord.js.org/#/
- The Riot Games API: https://developer.riotgames.com/
- A PostgreSQL database: https://www.postgresql.org/

Note that without a registered and approved product the Riot Games API key expires every 24 hours and needs to be regenerated in the Riot Developer Portal.
